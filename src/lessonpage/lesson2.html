                    <h3><b>WHAT IS IT</b></h3>
                    <div style="width: 80%; margin: auto; border: solid 2px; padding: 2px;">
                        <p>This module was designed and written to introduce to you a better understanding of how water resources are useful to humans and how we can conserve water in our small ways. </p>
                    </div>
                    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Water is a finite resource. We live on the driest continent in the world and, as the climate changes, sometimes we have enough water and sometimes we don’t.
                        Up to 70% of water used in schools is lost through leaks. A leaking bubbler wastes 7,000 liters of water every year.(Fecht 2019).
                        By exploring how we use water and identifying water loss in schools and at home, students recognize why and how we should care for water.</p>
                        <h3><b>Sources of Water</b></h3>
                            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Rainwater, oceans, rivers, lakes, streams, ponds and springs are natural sources of water.
                            Dams, wells, tube wells, hand-pumps, canals, etc, are man made sources of water. These are various sources of water.
                            About 97% of the water on the Earth’s surface is covered with water.</p>
                        <h3><b>Rain Water</b></h3>
                            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Rain water is collected on Earth in the form of surface water and underground water. </p><br><br>

                </div>
                    <h3><strong>Two Main Sources of water</strong></h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Groundwater - </strong>The water that is stored beneath the Earth's surface. It seeps through the soil and fills spaces in non-porous rocks.
                                When pressure builds up, this water can emerge naturally as springs. Groundwater can be accessed by digging wells or installing tube wells.
                                It flows through openings in rocks, and the rocks that store and allow the movement of groundwater are known as aquifers.</li>
                            <li><strong>Surface Water - </strong>It refers to the water found on the Earth's surface, including oceans, rivers, lakes, ponds, reservoirs, and streams.
                                This water primarily originates from rainfall and the melting of snow in mountainous regions.
                                Rivers, which are a major source of surface water, ultimately flow into the sea.</li>
                        </ol>
                    <h3><strong>Earth’s Water Distribution</strong></h3>
                        <p>The total amount of water in the planet, also known as Earth's water budget, generally remains constant through time.
                            Water moves and changes in form, but is neither created nor destroyed.
                            Only a very small percentage is added to the hydrologic system by volcanic eruptions and meteors from space.
                            Most of the water on Earth today has been cycling through the hydrologic system for billions of years.
                            You sent -97.5% Ocean -2.5% Freshwater (68.7%) from glaciers, (30.1%) from groundwater, (0.8%) form permafrost, surface water, and atmospheric water.
                            The surface water in rivers, lakes, swamps, soil moisture, living things, atmospheric water vapor, ground ice, and permafrost, constitute only about 0.4% of the total freshwater supply or less than 0.02% or the total water on Earth.</p>

                            <h4><u>Identifying Groundwater and Surface Water Resources</u></h4>
                                <p>Direction: On a separate sheet of paper, list at least five examples of groundwater and surface water resources.
                                    Be sure to distinguish between the two types of water sources.
                                    After completing the list, answer the following questions:</p>

                                        <b>Explanation:</b><br>
                                        While rainfall is a crucial source of water, it doesn't always guarantee enough water for a city.
                                        Factors like water storage, infrastructure, population growth, and seasonal variability can cause water shortages despite regular rainfall.
                                        Additionally, water quality and distribution play key roles. <br><br>
                                        <b>Scenario 2:</b> Answer: Fake <br>
                                        <b>Explanation:</b><br>
                                        Groundwater resources are finite. If aquifers are used faster than they are replenished, they can run dry.
                                        Over-extraction can lead to issues like groundwater depletion, land subsidence, and the intrusion of saltwater into freshwater aquifers. <br>
                                        <b>Scenario 3:</b> Answer: Fake <br>
                                        <b>Explanation:</b><br>
                                        While surface water is often used for irrigation, it is not always the best solution.
                                        The demand for water can lead to overuse and depletion of surface water resources, especially during droughts.
                                        Water conservation measures, such as drip irrigation, can help reduce waste and improve sustainability. <br>
                                        <b>Scenario 4:</b> Answer: Real <br>
                                        <b>Explanation:</b><br>
                                        Rainwater harvesting helps conserve both groundwater and surface water.
                                        It collects rainwater for use in homes, gardens, and agricultural practices, reducing the strain on traditional water sources and promoting sustainable water use. <br>
                                        <b>Scenario 5:</b> Answer: Fake <br>
                                        <b>Explanation:</b><br>
                                        Even in areas with abundant water, conservation is essential. Overuse of water resources can lead to long-term problems like depletion, pollution, and habitat destruction.
                                        Sustainable water management ensures the health of ecosystems and availability of water for future generations.

                        <h4>In Lesson 1, we learned about the different water resources on Earth, including surface water and groundwater, and why it's important to conserve them.<br><br>
                            Now, in Lesson 2, we will explore how water moves and changes in form through the natural processes known as the water cycle.<br><br>
                            By understanding the water cycle, we can make more informed decisions about how we conserve water.
                            The cycle explains how water is replenished, but also how it can be lost through evaporation, runoff, and other processes.
                            Recognizing this flow allows us to appreciate the natural balance and highlights the importance of protecting and managing our water resources effectively.

                    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">During this process, water changes its state from one phase to another, but the total number of water particles remains the same. In other words, if it were possible to collect and boil 100 gms of water, it will still retain a mass of 100 gms as steam. Likewise, if 100 gms of steam is collected and condensed, the resultant water would still weight 100 gms.</p>

                    <h3>Stages of Water Cycle</h3>
                    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">There are many processes involved in the movement of water apart from the major steps given in the above water cycle diagram. Listed below are different stages of the water cycle. BYJU'S. (n.d.).</p>

                    <span>1. Evaporation</span>
                    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">The sun is the ultimate source of energy, and it powers most of the evaporation that occurs on earth. Evaporation generally happens when water molecules at the surface of water bodies become excited and rise into the air. These molecules with the highest kinetic energy accumulate into water vapour clouds. Evaporation usually takes place below the boiling point of water. Another process called evapotranspiration occurs when evaporation occurs through the leaves of plants. This process contributes to a large percentage of water in the atmosphere.</p>

                    <span>2. Sublimation</span>
                    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Sublimation occurs when snow or ice changes directly into water vapour without becoming water. It usually occurs as a result of dry winds and low humidity. Sublimation can be observed on mountain peaks, where the air pressure is quite low. The low air pressure helps to sublimate the snow into water vapour as less energy is utilised in the process. Another example of sublimation is the phase where fog bellows from dry ice. On earth, the primary source of sublimation is from the ice sheets covering the poles of the earth.</p>

                    <span>3. Condensation</span>
                    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">The water vapour that accumulated in the atmosphere eventually cools down due to the low temperatures found at high altitudes. These vapours become tiny droplets of water and ice, eventually coming together to form clouds.</p>

                    <span>4. Precipitation</span>
                    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Above 0 degrees centigrade, the vapours will condense into water droplets. However, it cannot condense without dust or other impurities. Hence, water vapours attach itself on to the particle’s surface. When enough droplets merge, it falls out of the clouds and on to the ground below. This process is called precipitation (or rainfall). In particularly cold weather or extremely low air pressure, the water droplets freeze and fall as snow or hail.</p>

                    <span>5. Infiltration</span>
                    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Rainwater gets absorbed into the ground through the process of infiltration. The level of absorption varies based on the material the water has seeped into. For instance, rocks will retain comparatively less water than soil. Groundwater can either follows streams or rivers. But sometimes, it might just sink deeper, forming aquifers.</p>

                    <span>6. Runoff</span>
                    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">If the water from rainfall does not form aquifers, it follows gravity, often flowing down the sides of mountains and hills; eventually forming rivers. This process is called runoff. In colder regions, icecaps form when the amount of snowfall is faster than the rate of evaporation or sublimation. The biggest icecaps on earth are found at the poles.</p>

                    <br><br>
                    <p>All the steps mentioned above occur cyclically with neither a fixed beginning nor an end.</p>

                    <span>According to the Water Science School (2018). The water cycle is the major source of returning water back to the oceans. The process occurs in the following ways:</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The water cycle begins in the oceans.</li>
                        <li>The sun heats the water in the oceans.</li>
                        <li>The water evaporates as water vapours into the air.</li>
                        <li>The ice and snow sublimate directly into vapour.</li>
                        <li>The evaporated water from the oceans along with the water that transpired from the plants rises up in the atmosphere with the air currents.</li>
                        <li>These vapours condense into clouds that move around the globe by air currents.</li>
                        <li>The particles of the cloud grow, collide and fall out of the sky as precipitation.</li>
                        <li>Some precipitation falls as snow that accumulates as glaciers and ice caps that can store frozen water for several years.</li>
                        <li>The rest falls as rain into the oceans or on the land.</li>
                        <li>The water from the land flows into the rivers, ponds and lakes that eventually fall into the oceans.</li>
                        <li>This is how the water is returned back to the oceans.</li>
