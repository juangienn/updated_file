                        <span>The Concept of Water Conservation</span>

                            <p>Water conservation is the practice of using water wisely and efficiently to preserve this essential natural resource.
                                The concept is based on the understanding that freshwater is limited,
                                and its availability is under increasing pressure due to population growth, pollution, and climate change.</p><br>
                            <p>Water on Earth exists in a continuous cycle known as the water cycle—evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection.
                                While this cycle helps replenish water sources, the amount of usable freshwater is less than 1% of all water on Earth.
                                The rest is either saltwater in oceans or frozen in polar ice caps.</p><br>
                            <p>Water conservation involves reducing wastage, protecting water quality, and improving water use efficiency.
                                The goal is not just to save water today, but to ensure its availability for future generations,
                                protect ecosystems, and reduce the energy required to process and deliver water.</p>

                            <h3>Water conservation practices can be grouped into two main types:</h3><br>
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Behavioral Changes </b>– These involve modifying our daily habits to use less water.
                                For example, turning off the tap when not in use or collecting rainwater for watering plants.</li>
                            <li><b>Technological Solutions</b>– These include using water-saving devices like low-flow fixtures, smart irrigation systems, and wastewater treatment technologies.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>Just like energy conservation is essential for sustainability, water conservation is key to environmental balance, economic development, and public health. <br><br>
                            We will measure water usage typically in liters (L) or cubic meters (m³), and reducing even small amounts per person can lead to massive savings at the community or national level. <br><br>
                            Let us now explore how our actions affect water supply and what steps we can take to become water-wise citizens. </p>

                        <span>WHAT I CAN DO	</span>
                            <p>Solve the following word problem:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>1.	Maria noticed that a faucet in her home was leaking at a rate of 1 drop per second.
                                    She placed a container under the faucet and discovered that it collected <strong>4 liters of water in 24 hours.</strong><br>
                                    If she leaves the leak unattended for 30 days, how much water will be wasted in a month?</li><br>
                                    <p><i>Show your solution and final answer.</i></p>
                                </ol>
