                <span>5.1 Importance of Water Conservation</span>    
                <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;">
                    <div style="width: 60%; margin: auto;">
                        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Water conservation is important for in order for the planet to sustain its ecosystem and to ensure the continuous accessibility of clean water until future. As worldwide freshwater use has expanded nearly six-fold since 1900, the demand on this critical resource has intensified, leading to substantial water stress in diverse places (Ritchie & Roser, 2024). The largest user of water, the agriculture sector is responsible for a significant number of freshwater withdrawals globally. Effective water management techniques, like drip irrigation, are important for lowering consumption and lessening the negative effects of climate change and droughts on food security.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div style="width: 40%; margin: auto;">

                </div>

                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Additionally, there have been variations in the amount of water used in households; for example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a rise in the amount used because more people were staying at home. This emphasizes how important it is to adopt water-saving practices into daily life and to raise public awareness of them. We can save the energy used for water distribution and treatment, save aquatic habitats, and cut expenses associated with water supply by encouraging conservation initiatives.</p>

                <span>5.2 Role of Chemistry in Addressing Water-Related Challenges</span>

                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Chemistry is essential for solving many problems pertaining to water. In order to ensure safe drinking water, it is helpful to understand the composition and quality of the water. Water treatment plants use chemical procedures to clean water sources of pollutants and pathogens. For example, improved oxidation processes can degrade dangerous substances, and chlorination is a common approach used to clean drinking water (Hancock, 2023).</p>

                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Chemistry also facilitates the development of wastewater treatment technologies like chemical precipitation and membrane filtration, which not only help purify water but also recover valuable materials from wastewater, thus reducing the demand for fresh water (US EPA, 2024).</p>

                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">By understanding the chemical interactions in natural waters, we can better manage ecosystems and mitigate pollution, which is crucial for sustaining water resources.</p>

                <h3>USING CATALYST TO SAVE WATER IN CHEMICAL REACTIONS</h3>
                
                <span>What is a Catalyst?</span>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">A substance that speeds up a chemical reaction without getting consumed in the process is called a catalyst. This is accomplished by reducing the activation energy, which is the minimum amount of energy required for a reaction to take place (Lerner, 2011).</p>

                <span>How Catalysts Help Save Water?</span>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Water as a Safer Medium: </b>Catalysts allow reactions to happen in water instead of harmful organic solvents, making the process safer and more eco-friendly.</li>

                    <li><b>Faster Reactions: </b>Less time means less water is needed for cooling or washing during the process.</li>
                    
                    <li><b>Selective Reactions:</b> Catalysts can target specific products, avoiding unwanted byproducts and reducing the need for additional cleaning or water.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><b>Example:</b></p>

                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">In water treatment, heterogeneous catalysts help break down pollutants faster, which means quicker purification and less water wasted (US EPA, 2024).</p>

                        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Wastewater treatment is a critical process that ensures water used in homes and industries is cleaned before being released back into the environment. This process involves several stages designed to remove contaminants and pollutants, making the water safe for discharge or reuse. <br><br>
                            Water used at home or in industries goes through several steps before being released or reused:</p>

                    <li><b>Collection –</b> Wastewater comes from homes, factories, and rain.</li>
                    <li><b>Pre-Treatment  –</b> Removes large debris using screens.</li>
                    <li><b>Primary Treatment  –</b> Solids settle as sludge, which is removed.</li>
                    <li><b>Secondary Treatment  –</b> Bacteria and oxygen break down organic waste.</li>

                <h3>GREEN CHEMISTRY AND ITS ROLE IN WATER CONSERVATION</h3>

                <span>4.2.1 What is Green Chemistry? </span>
                <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;">
                    <div style="width: 60%; margin: auto;">
                        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">A scientific method known as "green chemistry" aims to create chemical products and processes with as little or no usage of dangerous materials as possible. It includes a set of guidelines aimed at lessening the negative effects on the environment, improving safety, and advancing sustainability in the production and use of chemicals. Green chemistry makes a substantial contribution to preserving water resources and preserving water quality by stopping pollution at its source.</p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Green chemistry is the design of chemical products and processes that reduce or eliminate the use or generation of hazardous substances. Green chemistry applies across the life cycle of a chemical product, including its design, manufacture, use, and ultimate disposal.</p>
                    </div>

                <span>4.2.2 How Does Green Chemistry Help Save Water?</span>
                <p><b>Green chemistry aids in water conservation through various mechanisms:</b></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Reduction of Water Usage: Many green chemistry processes are designed to require less water than traditional methods. For instance, supercritical CO₂ cleaning technologies can replace water in cleaning applications, saving millions of gallons daily.</li>

                    <li>Minimization of Contaminants: By using safer chemicals and processes, green chemistry reduces the release of harmful substances into water systems, thus improving overall water quality.</li>

                    <li>Sustainable Water Treatment: Green chemistry approaches to water purification involve biological agents and eco-friendly technologies that are more efficient than conventional methods. This reduces the need for extensive water treatment processes that consume large amounts of water.</li>
                </ul>


                <span>Examples of Green Chemistry in Daily Life</span>

                <ul>
                    <li>Eco-Friendly Cleaning Products: Many cleaning products now use less water in their formulations or utilize supercritical CO₂ instead of traditional solvents.</li>

                    <li>Water-Based Paints and Coatings: These products replace solvent-based formulations, significantly reducing the amount of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released into the environment.</li>
                    
                    <li>Biodegradable Detergents: These detergents are designed to break down more quickly in the environment, reducing pollution and conserving water during washing processes.</li>
