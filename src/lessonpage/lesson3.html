                    would happen if we ran out of it when you turned on a faucet? The health of
                    our ecosystems and the availability and safety of our water can be
                    significantly impacted by human activities such as forest destruction, river
                    pollution, and the introduction of non-native plants and animals. Every drop
                    we use is a part of a much larger tale.

                            <p>Water is essential to maintaining all ecosystems on Earth. It is essential
                                for maintaining the growth of plants, giving aquatic creatures permanent homes, and acting as a temporary residence or breeding ground for a variety
                                of insects, amphibians, and other organisms that depend on water. The

                                        worldwide. Industrial waste, agricultural runoff, and improper waste disposal
                                        introduce harmful chemicals and toxins into water bodies. These activities not

                        <span>2.1: Human Activities that Affect Water and Ecosystem</span>
                                <p>Let’s break down three major human activities that affect water and ecosystems:</p><br>
                                    <h4><b>1. Deforestation</b></h4>
                                    <img src="../../assets/images/mod3-7.png" alt="Conservation Techniques" style="width: 50%; border: 1.5em;"><br>
                                        <p>Deforestation refers to the clearing or thinning of forests by human
                                            activity and is one of the most significant global land use issues. Traditionally,
                                            deforestation is measured by the area of forest cleared for human purposes,
                                            such as harvesting trees for wood products or converting land for crops and
                                            grazing. In clear-cutting, all the trees are removed, leading to the complete
                                            destruction of the forest. In some cases, partial logging and accidental fires
                                            can also thin out trees, drastically altering the forest structure.</p><br>
                                    <img src="../../assets/images/mod3-8.png" alt="Conservation Techniques" style="width: 50%; border: 1.5em;"><br>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>When forests are cut down, the land becomes dry and erodes easily</li>
                                            <li>Trees help hold the soil and water in place. Without them, rainwater
                                                washes away soil, leading to muddy rivers and polluted water sources.</li>
                                            <li>Less forest cover also affects rainfall and water availability.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p><b>Example:</b></p>
                                            <p>When a forest near a river is cleared for farming, soil from the bare land
                                                can run off into the river. This makes the water dirty and affects fish and other
                                                aquatic life.</p><br>
                                    <h4><b>2. Pollution</b></h4>

                                        <p>Water pollution is the release of harmful substances into groundwater,
                                            lakes, rivers, streams, estuaries, and oceans, to the point that it disrupts the
                                            natural functioning of ecosystems or interferes with the beneficial use of
                                            water. This includes the discharge of chemicals, trash, microorganisms, and
                                            even energy in the form of heat or radioactivity. These pollutants can degrade
                                            water quality, harm aquatic life, and impact human health and the
                                            environment.</p>

                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Factories, homes, and farms release waste into rivers, lakes, and oceans.</li>
                                            <li>Chemicals, plastics, and even human waste can poison water and harm or kill living organisms.</li>
                                            <li>Polluted water is unsafe for drinking, fishing, swimming, and even farming.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    <p><b>Example:</b></p><br>

                                            belong to an ecosystem and often causes harm when introduced. Many invasive species enter new environments by accident, through activities like
                                            global trade or travel. The method by which an invasive species enters a new ecosystem is known as a pathway.</p>

                                <span><b>2.2: Causes of Water Pollution</b></span>
                                    <h4><b><i>What are the causes of water pollution?</i></b></h4>
                                        <p>There are many causes of water pollution. Below, we will focus on seven of the major ways that water can become polluted.</p>
                        <h2><b>1. Solid waste</b></h2>
                            <p>Improper disposal of solid waste, including garbage, electronic waste,
                                and construction debris, is a major contributor to water pollution,
                                especially in developing countries with inadequate waste management
                                systems. Plastics, in particular, pose a significant threat to aquatic
                                ecosystems, as they break down into microplastics that are harmful to
                                marine life and have been found in both marine organisms and
                                drinking water. These pollutants can leach harmful chemicals, damage
                                18 ecosystems, and potentially enter the food chain, raising concerns about their long-term health effects.
                                </p>
                        <h2><b>2. Industrial Waste</b></h2>
                            <p>Industries worldwide are major contributors to water pollution, often
                                producing toxic chemicals and pollutants that can contaminate nearby
                                freshwater systems if not properly managed. Improperly treated
                                industrial waste from agricultural sites, mines, and manufacturing
                                plants can enter rivers, streams, and eventually the ocean, making water
                                unsafe for human use. Additionally, the toxic chemicals in industrial
                                waste can alter water temperatures, creating harmful conditions for
                                aquatic organisms.</p>
                        <h2><b>3. Marine Dumping</b></h2>
                            <p>Marine dumping refers to the practice of discarding garbage directly
                                into the ocean, a method still used by some countries worldwide. Items
                                like household waste can take anywhere from two to 200 years to
                                decompose, contributing to long-lasting pollution. This practice harms
                                marine ecosystems and poses significant environmental challenges.
                                </p>
                        <h2><b>4. Sewage and Wastewater</b></h2>
                            <p>Even after treatment, sewage and wastewater can still contain harmful
                                chemicals, bacteria, and pathogens. When this wastewater is released
                                into the sea along with freshwater, it introduces disease-causing
                                organisms that can lead to health issues in both humans and animals.
                                These contaminants pose a significant threat to public health and
                                marine life.</p>
                        <h2><b>5. Oil Leaks and Spills</b></h2>
                            <p>The phrase "like water and oil" illustrates how these two substances do
                                not mix or dissolve. Similarly, oil spills and leaks, often resulting from
                                offshore drilling or oil transport ships, are major contributors to water
                                pollution. These accidents can have devastating effects on marine life
                                and ecosystems.</p>
                        <h2><b>6. Agriculture</b></h2>
                            <p>To protect crops from bacteria and insects, farmers often use chemicals
                                and pesticides. However, these substances can seep into groundwater,
                                posing risks to animals, plants, and humans. When it rains, the
                                chemicals mix with rainwater, flowing into rivers and streams,
                                ultimately reaching the ocean and contributing to further water
                                pollution.</p>
                        <h2><b>7. Global Warming</b></h2>
                            <p>Rising temperatures due to global warming are a significant concern for
                                water pollution. As water temperatures increase, it can lead to the death
                                of aquatic animals, disrupting ecosystems. Large die-offs of marine life
                                can further pollute the water, worsening the overall water quality and
                                amplifying the pollution problem.</p>
